This project involves the design and development of a responsive and interactive front-end interface for an e-learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform should support multiple core features including course listing, video embedding, and progress tracking. The user interface must consist of multiple pages: a **Home Page** for listing available courses, a **Course Details Page** for viewing and interacting with course content, and a **User Dashboard** to monitor learning progress.
The **Home Page** displays a list of courses with brief descriptions and links to detailed course pages. The **Course Page** includes an embedded video player for lesson delivery and a progress bar that updates when videos are completed. The **Dashboard Page** summarizes user progress across all enrolled courses, providing a clear and concise learning overview.
Styling should ensure a clean and modern look, with intuitive navigation and a user-friendly layout. JavaScript is used to handle interactivity, such as updating progress dynamically based on video completion. This front-end design serves as a foundation for future integration with a backend for user authentication, content management, and data persistence. The goal is to deliver a polished, functional UI prototype ready for real-world deployment or enhancement.
